Alright.

How do I want to design this adventure game in a OO kinda style?

The setting is the control room, which has various things you can interact with. Are their other rooms?

How does Thy DungeonMan work?

Alright so:

* type a command
* screen prints out both the result of that command, and the description of where you currently are.


Hrrrm, so a OneCharAtTimeWrapper would be made up of text from multiple sources....  how would i do line breaks?

or....

could have two sections, one for results of last command and one for description of environment?

description is blank if nothing there?

one awaits the other.

should i modify how one car at a time works?
yes.




so....action instances s have associated point values. how to know total? have array of all actions and they sum automatically.

Alright. What first.

Rooms. Needs to start somewhere.
