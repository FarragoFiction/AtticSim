Alright.

How do I want to design this adventure game in a OO kinda style?

The setting is the control room, which has various things you can interact with. Are their other rooms?

How does Thy DungeonMan work?

Alright so:

* type a command
* screen prints out both the result of that command, and the description of where you currently are.


Hrrrm, so a OneCharAtTimeWrapper would be made up of text from multiple sources....  how would i do line breaks?

or....

could have two sections, one for results of last command and one for description of environment?

description is blank if nothing there?

one awaits the other.

should i modify how one car at a time works?
yes.




so....action instances s have associated point values. how to know total? have array of all actions and they sum automatically.




~~~~~~~~

Alright. What first.

Rooms. Needs to start somewhere.



~~~~~~

How do I want use/deploy etc to work? Not looking for this to be overly hard.

If you deploy an item, it asks the room what happens to it?

Default is it's now just in the room, but it might also change the state of something in the room
(like unlocking the CONTROL CONSOLE) or letting you decorate the UNICORN.


what are some examples of items that are usable?

if you are wearing the wig, you can RIDE the unicorn for points.

you can use the wig on the unicorn to make STYLISH UNICORN. (if room has unicorn)


use PL's book in the CONTROL CONSOLE to gain access to it.


if more than 2 gundums in a room and you use another gundum it becomes SHOGUN GUNDUM.

sounds like there's few enough of these that they can just be methods and not objects or....hrrm..

can give a room a list of "special uses"? but it's not the room...it's the items....


if "use wig" and room contains unicorn, ride the unicorn.

static list of 'uses'?

how do i know it's a unicorn, though? maybe i should rework how i do items.

static name for Unicorn? or keep the item itself?

static array rideable?
static array wearable?

if inventory contains wearable, and room contains rideable, ride it.

hrrrrm....

if joinable.contain(useItem.name) && room.contains(joinable), from Shogun X?

Items can have lists of sub items for things like wearing a wig?


~~~

alright i've been brainstorming possible use cases, literally and i think they need to be attached to items

like, an item needs to have a "use" function passed to them, with the default one just displaying some 'use text';
default text getting used only gives you 1 point the first time and none the second, special ones give 10.

~~~~~~

alright i have default condition working okay but....

look at this:

defaultCondition()

it takes in nothing

but the next one i want to make is "has part x". Like, the console works if it has the password inside it.

so that has to take something into it. may as well take a list of items just in case.

can use that for "has all these x things inside it" or "hass all these x things in the room"



wait that's not enough.

i need to think through this use case.


the condition list is on the item so....


how would i do:

if have wig in inventory, ride horse.....hrm.
~~~~~

Fuck.

I'm screwing up. I keep forgetting parts of the use case while coding.

How do I fix this?

fuck it, let's not care about reuse, then.

~~~~~~~~

Alright. I took yesterday to recover from a bunch of stress, including getting this out in time.

Now what.`

I want to get this in a state that doesn't feel so 'unpolished' to me.

*  fix bugs

*~~~  Dare System. (JR can troll Shogun to get him to eat random shit.
    Happens if Shogun, or if you pick 'troll shogun' or whatever as
    JR she'll make a dare as well.
    just gives some thing the 'edible' trait. if it's already edible, diff text.

*~~ Dennis.
    anyone who has become trapped in teh Dennis realm is now an item in it's contents.
     how to implement this so 'you' are not visible? i think i have it. unless it's void (special because void),
     ask the controller what people are in this room and then list them.

* More 'be' easter eggs.
    (( i am going to add a bunch of ppl from main, but realize i actually don't know too much about who is active or not, anybody know? all sauce/juice players since that's so new.... all submods since activeness was a criteria for that... anybody i see posting on general today that i recognize.... ))

* more puzzles like the wig. combine everything with everything maybe.

*~~try to make it so you can't submit a command if it's still typing
